## Overview of the analysis
I. Examples to perform ML algorithm.


## Results 
#### Data Preprocessing

     II. what variable(s) that are considered the target(s) for your model?

     a. IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

    what variable(s) that are considered to be the features for your model?

     b. every column except the drop.

    What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  
     c. First features we drop are the 'EIN' & 'NAME'???

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

I dont know the answer to these questions. I do not have a clear grasp of deep and neural network. Therefore I am unable to perform the challenge. 

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


#### Summary: the model did well at 73% percentage.
