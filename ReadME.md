## Overview of the analysis
- network model using ML examples to perform ML algorithm.. compare columns of data and process the work?


## Results 
#### Data Preprocessing

what variable(s) that are considered the target(s) for your model?

IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

what variable(s) that are considered to be the features for your model

every column except the drop.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
First features we drop are the 'EIN' & 'NAME'???

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

I dont know the answer these questions. 

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


Summary: the model did well at 73% percentage.
