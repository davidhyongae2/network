    What variable(s) that are considered the target(s) for your model?

     a. IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

    What variable(s) that are considered to be the features for your model?

     b. Every column except the drop.

    What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  
     c. 'EIN' & 'NAME'???


#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model




#### Summary: 
the model did well at 73% percentage.
